TO DO:
  - use yaml for config files
  - packetize

  - boggle 6x6

  - !repeat to repeat preamble
  - Match-play feature
  - Fix text when someone ties first or second. Seems to happen when someone comes from outside the top 3.
  - Bonus cube in Boggle round
  - Different text for people newly entering the top 3
  - Optional bonus points for getting a maximum (not for anag, defn or rounds with similarly few valid words)
  - Admin tools
  - Make bot reconnect automatically on disconnect, pausing and preserving game state
  - Introduction/rules command
  - Begin dynamic hints with the initially-generated hint
  - Global hint amount adjustment
  - Optional playoffs (first to win a single round) to decide ties, or use other criteria (to be decided)
  - Timed (single-letter?) hints for single-answer rounds (e.g. anag)
  - Permit ties if the word submitted is different (optional extra togglable in cfg.py)
  - Add ability to run on multiple servers/channels, sanity checking (must have at least one round type,
    cannot pick from empty modifier list, etc.)
  - Add special flags to rounds and modifiers (so they can e.g. opt into dynamic partial hinting)
  - Separate scoring code from game code
  - Redo the -NESS(ES) removal script to be morphologically aware, so that words like LIONESS and WITNESS aren't
    unfairly excluded.
  - Fix "1 seconds" text with absurdly low round (hence reset) times (1 or 2s)
  - Scoring modifications: stop alerting (but keep scores of) people who haven't submitted words in N rounds
    (configurable); announce top 3 at set intervals (configurable); command to check score; command to list top scores
    (within a certain stretch of time).
  - Missing vowels round (in the style of Only Connect)
